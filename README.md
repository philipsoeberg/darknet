Note: This is Philip Soeberg changes:

I use this project for my CCTV/ip-cams to identify people at my property through tight integration with Node-red.

I run this on a 4-core celeron, no NVIDIA acceleration unfortunatley.. time is 4 seconds on yolov2-tiny

The restserver accept base64 jpg inputs and outputs a base64 marked image and a boolean if a person was detected
simple.. I wrote this fast.. it works, but it's written with a pitchfork
